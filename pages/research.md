#### <u>Migrant Remittances and Economic Growth: the role of financial development & institutional quality</u>
*This paper investigate the conditionel effect of remittances on economic growth in 14 Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries. Using unbalanced panel data over the period 1984-2015, we study the hypothesis that the effect of re- mittances on economic growth varies depending on the level of financial devel- opment and institutional environment in recipient countries. We use Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS/IV) instrumental variables method in which we address the endogeneity of remittances. Our results reveal a complementary relationship among financial development and remittances to ensure economic growth. The estimations show that remittances promote growth in countries with a developed financial sys- tem and a strong institutional environment.*

#### <u>Do political institutions improve the effect of remittances on economic growth? Evidence South-Mediterranean countries</u>
*This paper examines the link between remittances, institutions quality and economic growth for 11 South- Mediterranean countries (SMC) over the period 1984â€“2014. Based on a Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) estimation, the empirical analysis reveals three findings: institutions quality have a positive effect on economic growth, there is no direct link between remittances and economic growth and remittances and institutional quality are complements in enhancing economic growth.*
