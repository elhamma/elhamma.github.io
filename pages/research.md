#### <u>Migrant Remittances and Economic Growth: the role of financial development & institutional quality</u>
*This paper investigate the conditionel effect of remittances on economic growth in 14 Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries. Using unbalanced panel data over the period 1984-2015, we study the hypothesis that the effect of re- mittances on economic growth varies depending on the level of financial devel- opment and institutional environment in recipient countries. We use Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS/IV) instrumental variables method in which we address the endogeneity of remittances. Our results reveal a complementary relationship among financial development and remittances to ensure economic growth. The estimations show that remittances promote growth in countries with a developed financial sys- tem and a strong institutional environment.*
